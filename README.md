#  Atbash Cipher

**Project by:**

## Overview
This project implements the **Atbash Cipher**, a classical substitution cipher that reverses the alphabet.

For example:

A ↔ Z
B ↔ Y
C ↔ X


It is a symmetric cipher — meaning the same function is used for both encryption and decryption.



## Features
- Encrypts and decrypts text using the same logic  
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Keeps spaces, punctuation, and digits unchanged  
- Easy to use and simple implementation  



##  Example
**Input:**

Hello, World!

**Output:**

Svool, Dliow!
